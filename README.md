## Introduction
Hi there, I'm Hazel.

This page is to provide a place for me to put projects that I work on to illustrate my understanding and experience in a variety of programming and software concepts, as a portfolio of sorts.
Expect bits and pieces of all sorts of projects, languages, and frameworks as I work to learn them.

## About Me

I've been learning to program in an amateur capacity since 2015, when I was making minecraft mods by trial, error, and a lot of bugging people on the developer forums.
From these humble beginnings I have learned a lot about programming and software development, including getting my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and am now looking for work with this skillset.

I am proficient in Java, C, and Rust, and competent in many other languages and development environments. I run Linux wherever possible (arch btw).
